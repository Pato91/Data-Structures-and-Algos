# Data-Structures-and-Algos (C++)
This project is an on going effort to learn and understand the (at the time)basic algorithms 
in computer science to help you come up with your own variants and flavors of the same
algorithms. All the exercises and practices followed in this guide follow the book
**_[Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition](https://github.com/Pato91/Books/blob/master/C%2B%2B/A_Complete_Guide_to_Programming_in_C%2B%2B.pdf)_**

## How do we build?
In order to build quickly, you have to run the (clang++)command (at the root of the project);
> clang++ -std=c++<version -- 11, 14, 17> -stdlib=libc++ build.cc -o build

Incase you are using gcc, please find out what compile command is specific to gcc.

Then run the command (for linux) at the root of the project directory;
> ./build /to/file(from pwd/cwd)/to/be/compiled
